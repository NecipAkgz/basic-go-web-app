# Go-Chi Router Simple Web App README

This is a simple web application in Go (Golang) using the Go-Chi router. It serves as a basic template for building web applications in Go. The Go-Chi router is a lightweight, fast, and highly performant router that is ideal for building RESTful APIs and web services in Go.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have Go (Golang) installed. If not, you can download it [here](https://golang.org/dl/).

## Installation

To install and run this web application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
